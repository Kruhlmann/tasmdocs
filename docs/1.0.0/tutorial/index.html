    <h1>The TASM compiler</h1>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
        <code>tasmc</code> depends on a number of packages. To use the bootstrapper the developer will need nodejs
        version 14 or above in order to 
    </p>
    <h2>Using the compiler</h2>
    <p>
        The TASM compiler is typically installed as <code>/usr/bin/tasmc</code>, which allows the user to
        execute <code>tasmc</code>, whereever they are. <code>tasmc</code> takes two arguments, the source file
        (typically a file ending in <code>.tasm</code>) and an output file (typically a file without any file extension).
        <pre>
$ tasmc my_source_code.tasm my_binary
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h1>Introduction to TASM</h1>
    <p>
        TASM is a compiled language, which produces statically linked ELF64 binaries for linux using NASM.
        The language uses a stack oriented syntax similar to Forth.
    </p>
    <h2>The <code>main</code> submarine</h2>
    <p>
        The main submarine is the entrypoint for any TASM program. Without the main submarine the program will not compile.
        
        <pre>
sub main
    your code here...
marine
        </pre>
        This submarine will be executed at the start of the program, and will automatically exit with exit-code 0
        if the stack is properly cleaned.
    </p>
    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        TASM only has direct support for unsigned 64-bit integers, which means that operations such as addition, modulus and multiplication
        is fully supported while operations like division and subtraction is only partially supported. For instance, the 
        division operation in the <code>std.math</code> module acts as a floor division similar to the python 
        instraction <code>17 // 3 # results in 5</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A large part of a TASM program consists of push numbers to the stack in order to do math, access specific syscalls or
        apply offsets to a value. Numbers can be pushed to the stack by simply typing out the number:
    </p>
    <pre>
sub main
    14
marine
    </pre>
    <p>
        After this instruction the stack will look like this:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Top of stack</th></tr></thead>
        <tr><td>14</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&lt;returnptr&gt;</td></tr>
        <tfoot><tr><th>Bottom of stack</th></tr></tfoot>
    </table>
    <p>
        In order to avoid an error during runtime the number 14 has to be consumed somehow. If it is not consumed then the
        number will be used as the return address of the submarine, which will result in a segfault. One way to
        consume the number is to <code>put</code> it, which outputs the top element on the stack and removes it. 
    </p>
    <pre>
sub main
    14 put
marine
    </pre>
    <p>
        This will result in <code>14</code> being printed to stdout and the program exiting with code 0.
